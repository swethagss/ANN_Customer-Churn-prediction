# ANN_Customer-Churn-prediction

--> This repository contains an implementation of a Customer Churn Prediction Model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). 
--> The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will churn (leave) based on various features using a neural network model. 
-->The project demonstrates key aspects of building, training, saving, and loading an ANN model for churn prediction
